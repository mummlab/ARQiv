#' ARQiv R* package: Preparing for and Completing Whole-Organism Screening at High-througput rates
#'
#' The ARQiv R* package includes functions that fall into two categories - those applied to
#' 'Pre-screening Assay Optimization' and 'Compound Analysis'. The functions allow the user to
#' calculate background signal, determine sample size, run quality control tests, perform virtual
#' experiments to simulate compound efficacy - and finally, to perform compound analysis
#' during iterative drug screen cycles.
