Description:  The ARQiv R* package includes functions that fall into two categories - those applied to Pre-screening Assay Optimization' and 'Compound Analysis'. The functions allow the user to calculate background signal, determine sample size, run quality control tests, perform virtual experiments to simulate compound efficacy - and finally, to perform compound analysis during iterative drug screen cycles.
